📝 Abstract
The Movie Recommender System is designed to enhance user experience by suggesting movies based on their preferences. By employing cosine similarity, the system measures similarity between movies, enabling accurate and efficient recommendations. The project includes dataset preprocessing, model building, and a web interface for easy interaction.

🔍 Introduction
Recommender systems are integral to various platforms like e-commerce and OTT services. By analyzing user behaviors and preferences, they provide relevant suggestions, significantly improving user engagement and satisfaction.

This project focuses on three main types of recommendation systems:

Content-Based Filtering: Utilizes movie attributes like genre, director, and cast for recommendations.
Collaborative Filtering: Considers user-to-user and item-to-item similarities for personalized suggestions.
Hybrid Filtering: Combines both approaches for improved performance.


🌟 Features
Preprocessing of movie datasets to ensure data quality.
Conversion of movie attributes into vectors for computation.
Calculation of cosine similarity for generating recommendations.
A user-friendly web interface for input and result display.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Algorithm: Cosine Similarity
Deployment Framework: Flask


📈 Workflow
Data Preprocessing:
Collect movie datasets from APIs or CSV files.
Handle missing values, duplicates, and format inconsistencies.
Feature Extraction and Vectorization:
Extract attributes like genre, ratings, and cast.
Convert them into feature vectors.
Cosine Similarity Implementation:
Compute similarity scores between movie vectors.
Identify top recommendations based on similarity.
Web Deployment:
Develop a Flask-based web interface for user interaction.


✅ Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages
Simple and Effective: Easy to implement and understand.
Efficient with Sparse Data: Handles high-dimensional and sparse datasets.
Personalized Suggestions: Tailored recommendations for users.
Disadvantages
Data Dependency: Requires high-quality and well-structured datasets.
No Negative Correlation: Cannot handle negative relationships between attributes.
Vector Length Issues: Sensitive to variations in vector lengths.
